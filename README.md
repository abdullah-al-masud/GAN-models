# GAN-models

This repository involves different GAN practices like GAN from Ian J. Goodfellow's paper !["Generative Adversarial Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661), Conditional GAN, DCGAN and cDC-GAN using MNIST dataset. I am willing to make the repository rich with other GAN techniques too eventually.
